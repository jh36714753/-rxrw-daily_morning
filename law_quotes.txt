Laws grind the poor, and rich men rule the law.
People are more afraid of the laws of Man than of God, because their punishment seems to be nearest.
There is but one law for all, namely, that law which governs all law, the law of our Creator, the law of humanity, justice, equity -- the law of nature and of nations.
Law is not law, if it violates the principles of eternal justice.
The law is the public conscience.
The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.
One with the law is a majority.
No organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration. No foresight can anticipate nor any document of reasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions.
Lawyers are the only persons in whom ignorance of the law is not punished.
Laws are like cobwebs, which may catch small flies, but let wasps and hornets break through.
The precepts of the law may be comprehended under these three points: to live honestly, to hurt no man willfully, and to render every man his due carefully.
Without law men are beasts.
Law is order, and good law is good order.
No man-made law ever, no matter whether derived from the past or projected onto a distant, unforeseeable future, can or should ever be empowered to claim that it is greater than the Natural Law from which it stems and to which it must inevitably return in the eternal rhythm of creation and decline of all things natural.
Law without justice is a wound without a cure.
Law is an imperfect profession in which success can rarely be achieved without some sacrifice of principle. Thus all practicing lawyers -- and most others in the profession -- will necessarily be imperfect, especially in the eyes of young idealists. There is no perfect justice, just as there is no absolute in ethics. But there is perfect injustice, and we know it when we see it.
I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.
The law was made for one thing alone, for the exploitation of those who don't understand it.
A law is valuable, not because it is a law, but because there is right in it.
An unjust law is itself a species of violence.
The plaintiff and defendant in an action at law are two men ducking their heads in a bucket, and daring each other to remain longest under water.
Laws made by common consent must not be trampled on by individuals.
Laws, like houses, lean on one another.
It's a strange thing, we think that law brings order. Law doesn't. How do we know that law does not bring order? Look around us. We live under the rule of law. Notice how much order we have?
Law is the rudder of the ship of state.
So diverse and adverse are the decisions of different high courts, and of the same high court, that in examining cases, as precedents by which to try a suit, the lawyer encounters a perpetual change of cloud and sunshine, and occasionally a real thunder storm, succeeded by a burning sun. What was law at one time, is not law now--what is law in one place, is not in another--locality, individuality, prejudice, and perpetual change, characterize the decisions of judges learned in the law.
It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can stop him from lynching me, and I think that's pretty important.
It is wrong to consider that courts are established for the benefit of the people. Those who want to perpetuate their power do so through the courts. If people were to settle their own quarrels, a third party would not be able to exercise any authority over them. Truly, men were less unmanly when they settled their disputes either by fighting or by asking their relatives to decide for them. They became more unmanly and cowardly when they resorted to the courts of law. It was certainly a sign of savagery when they settled their disputes by fighting. Is it any less so, if I ask a third party to decide between you and me? Surely, the decision of a third party is not always right. The parties alone know who is right. We, in our simplicity and ignorance, imagine that a stranger, by taking our money, gives us justice.
Even when laws have been written down, they ought not always to remain unaltered.
Although I broke a lot of laws as a teenager, I straightened out immediately upon turning eighteen, when I realized the state had a legal right to execute me.
I don't go by what the law say. The law's liable to say anything. I go by if it's right or not. It doesn't matter what the law say. I take and look at it for myself.
The end of law is not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge freedom. For in all the states of created beings, capable of laws, where there is no law there is no freedom.
The final test of civilization of a people is the respect they have for law.
When I hear any man talk of an unalterable law, the only effect it produces upon me is to convince me that he is an unalterable fool.
Law is a bottomless pit.
Bad laws are the worst sort of tyranny.
Who to himself is law, no law doth need. Offends no law, and is a king indeed.
Courts are places where the ending is written first and all that precedes is simply vaudeville.
Ignorance of the law is no good excuse, where every man is bound to take notice of the laws to which he is subject.
Every new time will give its law.
Laws are confusing documents. They get in the way of justice.
In truth, laws are always useful to those with possessions and harmful to those who have nothing; from which it follows that the social state is advantageous to men only when all possess something and none has too much.
People crushed by law, have no hopes but from power. If laws are their enemies, they will be enemies to laws; and those who have much to hope and nothing to lose, will always be dangerous.
Laws ought to be fashioned unto the manners and conditions of the people whom they are meant to benefit, and not imposed upon them according to the simple rule of right.
Where there are laws, innocence need not tremble.
Of all injustice that is the greatest which goes under the name of law.
Laws and institutions are constantly tending to gravitate. Like clocks, they must be occasionally cleansed, and wound up, and set to true time.
Every law is an evil, for every law is an infraction of liberty.
No one will ever comprehend the arrested civilizations unless he sees the strict dilemma of early society. Either men had no law at all, and lived in confused tribes, hardly hanging together, or they had to obtain a fixed law by processes of incredible difficulty. Those who surmounted that difficulty soon destroyed all those that lay in their way who did not.
No laws, however stringent, can make the idle industrious, the thriftless provident, or the drunken sober.
The Law ... is perfection of reason.
Laws or ordinances unobserved, or partially attended to, had better never have been made.
Law ... is the clear, translucent stream of justice, flowing freely and smoothly between the banks of wisdom and truth, purified by mercy and equity. As found upon our statue books, this highway of justice, like some of our rivers, is interrupted in its free course, by individual dams, sand bars, snags, and flood wood; often changing the channel, and causing many a shipwreck.
Societies start moving menacingly on the lines of Whataboutery when law is not applied equally and justly to all.
We may brave human laws, but we cannot resist natural ones.
The Law is hard, but it is the Law.
Reason is the life of the law, nay the common law is nothing else but reason.
No man is above the law, and no man is below it.
For in a government of laws and not of men, no man, however prominent or powerful, and no mob however unruly or boisterous, is entitled to defy a court of law. If this country should ever reach the point where any man or group of men by force or threat of force could long defy the commands of our court and our Constitution, then no law would stand free from doubt, no judge would be sure of his writ, and no citizen would be safe from his neighbors.
[The Utopians] have no lawyers among them, for they consider them as a sort of people whose profession it is to disguise matters and to wrest the laws, and, therefore, they think it is much better that every man should plead his own cause, and trust it to the judge, as in other places the client trusts it to a counsellor; by this means they both cut off many delays and find out truth more certainly; for after the parties have laid open the merits of the cause, without those artifices which lawyers are apt to suggest, the judge examines the whole matter, and supports the simplicity of such well-meaning persons, whom otherwise crafty men would be sure to run down; and thus they avoid those evils which appear very remarkably among all those nations that labour under a vast load of laws.
A man with a club is a law-maker.
The convoluted wording of legalisms grew up around the necessity to hide from ourselves the violence we do to each other.
Good laws lead to the making of better ones; bad ones bring about worse.
Laws are made by the old, exceptions by the young.
The law no passion can disturb. 'Tis void of desire and fear, lust and anger. 'Tis mens sine affectu, written reason, retaining some measure of the divine perfection. It does not enjoin that which pleases a weak, frail man, but, without any regard to persons, commands that which is good and punishes evil in all, whether rich or poor, high or low.
Necessity has no law.
Our legislature has continued to take the ridiculous approach of using a fire axe to open an unlocked door as opposed to merely using a more nuanced and slight adjustment to correct a perceived flaw in the current law.
The judge is nothing but the law speaking.
Bad laws are not forever and if we work together, we can change them.
Laws are only as good as those that enforce them.
Laws change as the seasons.
One of the advantages of having laws is the pleasure one may take in breaking them.
If a man sets out to study all the laws, he will have no time left to transgress them.
Use law and physic only for necessity; they that use them otherwise abuse themselves unto weak bodies, and light purses; they are good remedies, bad businesses, and worse recreations.
Almost any sect, cult, or religion will legislate its creed into law if it acquires the political power to do so, and will follow it by suppressing opposition, subverting all education to seize early the minds of the young, and by killing, locking up, or driving underground all heretics.
One may well ask: "How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?" The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal, but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that "an unjust law is no law at all."
Wherever Law ends, Tyranny begins.
It would then be most admirably adapted to the purposes of justice, if laws properly enacted were, as far as circumstances admitted, of themselves to mark out all cases, and to abandon as few as possible to the discretion of the judge.
Men seldom understand any laws but those they feel.
Laws are not masters but servants, and he rules them who obeys them.
